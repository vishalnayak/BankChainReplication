		      Project: Chain Replication

============================================================
OVERVIEW

Implement chain replication, as described in

  [vRS2004chain] Robbert van Renesse and Fred B. Schneider.  Chain
  Replication for Supporting High Throughput and Availability.  In
  Proceedings of the 6th Symposium on Operating Systems Design and
  Implementation (OSDI), pages 91-104.  USENIX Association, 2004.
  http://www.cs.cornell.edu/fbs/publications/ChainReplicOSDI.pdf

Also, design and implement an extension to handle an operation that
involves multiple chains, as described below.

Chain replication is also described in

  [vrG2010replication] Robbert van Renesse and Rachid Guerraoui.
  Replication Techniques for Availability. In Replication: Theory and
  Practise, Bernadette Charron-Bost, Fernando Pedone, and Andre Schiper,
  editors, volume 5959 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 19-40.
  Springer-Verlag, 2010.
  http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/cs5414/2012fa/publications/vRG10.pdf

The algorithm is fundamentally the same in both papers, but some details
differ.  The first paper is more detailed in some respects, so it will be
our primary reference, but the second paper is also worth reading.

{UPDATE 2014-09-26]
Your implementation must allow each server to run on a different machine.

{UPDATE 2014-09-29]
All communication must be explicit using some form of messages.  Use of
shared files or distributed shared memory is not permitted.

To simplify the correctness proof, the papers describe the protocol as
storing a complete history (sequence of updates) for each object.  As the
papers point out, an actual implementation (like yours!) should store the
current state of each object instead.

This project is inspired in part by the project for Fred Schneider's Fall
2012 CS5414 Distributed Computing Principles, available at
http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/cs5414/2012fa/

============================================================
FUNCTIONALITY OF THE REPLICATED SERVICE

the replicated service stores bank account information.  it stores the
following information for each account: (1) balance, (2) sequence of
processed updates, denoted processedTrans.

the service supports the following query and update requests.  the reply to
each request is an instance of the class Reply, shown below as a tuple for
brevity.

enum Outcome { Processed, InconsistentWithHistory, InsufficientFunds }

class Reply {
  string reqID;
  Outcome outcome;
  float balance;
}

note: making request identifiers strings (rather than numbers) allows them
to have structure, e.g., "1.1.1".  this makes it easier to generate unique
request identifiers, using a structure such as
bankName.clientNumber.sequenceNumber.

QUERIES

  getBalance(reqID, accountNum): returns <reqID, Processed, balance>.

UPDATES

  [UPDATE 2014-10-04: in each of the following 3 paragraphs, I replaced "if
  exactly the same transaction has already been processed for this account,
  simply return <reqID, Processed, balance>." with "if exactly the same
  transaction has already been processed, re-send the same reply."]

  deposit(reqID, accountNum, amount): if a transaction with this reqID has
  not been processed for this account, increase the account balance by the
  amount, append the transaction to processedTrans, and return <reqID,
  Processed, balance>, where balance is the current balance.  if exactly
  the same transaction has already been processed, re-send the same reply.
  if a different transaction with the same reqID has been processed for
  this account, return <reqID, InconsistentWithHistory, balance>.

  withdraw(reqId, accountNum, amount): if a transaction with this reqID has
  not been processed for this account, and the account balance is at least
  the amount, decrease the account balance by the amount, append the
  transaction to processedTrans, and return <reqID, Processed, balance>.
  if a transaction with this reqID has not been processed for this account,
  and the account balance is less than the amount, return <reqID,
  InsufficientFunds, balance>.  if exactly the same transaction has already
  been processed, re-send the same reply.if a different transaction with
  the same reqID has been processed, return <reqID,
  InconsistentWithHistory, balance>.

  transfer(reqID, accountNum, amount, destBank, destAccount): if a
  transaction with this reqID has not already been processed, and the
  account balance is at least the transfer amount, then transfer the
  requested amount of funds from the specified account in this bank to
  destAccount in destBank, and return <reqID, Processed, balance>.  if a
  transfer with this reqID has not already been processed, and the account
  balance is less than the transfer amount, return <reqID,
  InsufficientFunds, balance>.  if exactly the same transaction has already
  been processed, re-send the same reply.  if a different transaction with
  the same reqID has been processed, return <reqID, InconsistentWithHistory, 
  balance>.  [UPDATE, 2014-09-17: added the following] It is acceptable for
  a server of either the source bank or the destination bank to send a
  reply to the client.  However, the client should send the request only to
  a server of the source bank; the client should not need to send a request
  to a server of the destination bank.

============================================================
SIMPLIFICATIONS

if an account mentioned in a request does not already exist, then it is
automatically created, with initial balance 0, and then the request is
processed as described above.

assume clients never send requests with non-positive amounts.

assume the master never fails.  therefore, you do not need to implement
Paxos.

the same master is used by all banks.  the master reports every failure to
all servers of all banks.  [UPDATE, 2014-09-18: the master also reports
failures to clients.]

assume that the pattern of failures is limited so that there is always at
least one living server for each bank.

it is sufficient to store all information in RAM.  it's OK that information
stored by a process is lost when the process fails or terminates.

it is sufficient to test your system with all of the clients being threads
in a single process.  you should run testcases with up to 3 banks and up to
6 clients per bank.

============================================================
NETWORK PROTOCOLS

as stated in the paper, communication between servers (including the
master) should be reliable, so use TCP as the underlying network protocol
for it, and assume that TCP is reliable.  this applies to communication
between servers in the same or different chains.

communication between clients and servers may be unreliable, so use UDP as
the underlying network protocol for it.  for simplicity, assume that each
request or reply fits in a single UDP packet.

============================================================ 
CONFIGURATION FILE

all clients, servers, and the master read information from a configuration
file whose name is specified on the command line.  for simplicity, all
three kinds of processes read the same configuration file, and each kind of
process ignores the information it does not need.  note: this implies that
configuration file contains information for all banks.

the configuration file contains enough information to specify a testcase;
thus, you can run different testcases simply by supplying different
configuration files.  information in the configuration file includes (but
is not limited to): the names of the banks, the length of the chain for
each bank, Internet addresses and port numbers of the master and servers
(for all banks), the number of clients of each bank, a description of the
requests submitted by each client (explained below), server
startup delays, and server lifetimes (explained below).

the configuration file should have a self-describing syntax.  instead of
each line containing only a value, whose meaning depends on the line number
(where it is hard for readers to remember which line number contains which
value), each line should contain a label and a value, so the reader easily
sees the meaning of each value.

the description of a client's requests in the configuration file can have
one of two forms: (1) a single item random(seed, numReq, probGetBalance,
probDeposit, probWithdraw, probTransfer), where seed is a seed for a
pseudo-random number generator, numReq is the number of requests that will
be issued by this client, and the remaining parameters (which should sum to
1) are the probabilities of generating the various types of requests.  (2)
a sequence of items, each representing one request using some readable and
easy-to-parse syntax, such as "(getBalance, 1.1.1, 46)".  the configuration
file should also contain separate entries controlling the following: the
duration a client waits for a reply, before either resending the request or
giving up on it; the number of times a client re-sends a request before
giving up on it; whether the client re-sends a request to the new head for
a bank, if the client, while waiting for a reply from that bank, is
notified by the master of failure of the head for the bank.

the configuration file specifies a startup delay (in milliseconds) for
each server.  a server's main thread does essentially nothing except sleep
until the server's startup delay has elapsed.  this feature facilitates
testing of the algorithm for incorporating new servers (i.e., extending the
chain).  servers that are part of the initial chain have a startup delay of
zero.

the configuration file specifies a lifetime for each server, which may be
(1) "receive" and a number n (the server terminates immediately after
receiving its n'th message), (2) "send" and a number n (the server
terminates immediately after sending its n'th message), or (3) "unbounded"
(the server never terminates itself).  furthermore, the number n in (1) and
(2) can be replaced with the string "random", in which case the server
generates a random number in a reasonable range, outputs it to a log file,
and uses that number.

configuration files that satisfy some variant of the above requirements are
also acceptable, provided they provide a comparable level of control, as
needed for thorough testing of fault-tolerant distributed systems.

tip: you will have numerous configuration files.  to help keep track of them,
organize them into folders, and try to give them meaningful names.

[UPDATE 2014-10-03: added the following.]  for non-fault-tolerant service
(phase2), you do not need to consider scenarios with message loss between
clients and servers.  for subsequent phases, you do need to consider such
scenarios, because such with message loss is one of the types of failures
that chain replication is designed to tolerate.  you will need to introduce
such failures synthetically (i.e., simulate them), in a similar way as
server lifetimes (specified in the configuration file) are used to simulate
server failures.  you should introduce some lines in the configuration file
to specify when and how often message loss between clients and servers
occurs.

============================================================
LOGS

every process should generate a comprehensive log file describing its
initial settings, the content of every message it received, the content of
every message it sent, and every significant internal action it took.
every log entry should contain a real-time timestamp.  every log entry for
a sent message should contain a send sequence number n, indicating that it
is for the n'th message sent by this process.  every log entry for a sent
message should contain a receive sequence number n, indicating that it is
for the n'th message received by this process.  (send and receive sequence
numbers are useful for choosing server lifetimes that correspond to
interesting failure scenarios.)  the log file should have a self-describing
syntax, in the same style as described for the configuration file.  for
example, each component of a message should be labeled to indicate its
meaning.

============================================================
FAILURE DETECTION

chain replication is designed to work correctly under the fail-stop model,
which assumes perfect failure detection (cf. [vRG2010replication, section
2.4]).  there are two completely different approaches to handling this.

one approach, suitable during development and testing, is to "fake" failure
detection.  specifically, when a server is preparing to terminate as
specified by its configuration, it sends a message announcing its
termination to the master.  with this approach, the master implements
failure detection simply by waiting for such notifications.  this
approach's advantage is guaranteed absence of false alarms.  this
approach's disadvantage is that unplanned failures (e.g., a process
terminating due to an uncaught exception) are not detected.

the other approach is to implement real failure detection, using timeouts.
for example, each server S sends a UDP packet containing S's name to the
master every 1 second.  every (say) 5 seconds, the master checks whether it
has received at least 1 message from each server that it believes is alive
during the past 5 seconds.  if not, it concludes that the uncommunicative
servers failed.  note that a few occasional dropped UDP packets should not
cause the master to conclude that a server has failed.  this approach never
misses real failures, but it can produce false alarms if enough packets are
dropped or delayed.

  aside: another approach is to keep a TCP connection open between the
  master and each server, and let exceptions raised by the TCP socket
  indicate server failure.  this approach is not recommended, because it is
  less transparent and less flexible.

you should adopt the second approach.  your testing scenarios will not
involve wide-area networks or high network congestion, so it should be easy
to find settings that avoid false alarms, and you will gain the experience
of implementing a failure detector.

============================================================
PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

Each team will implement most of the project (all except the last phase) in
two programming languages.  This will provide experience implementing
distributed systems in different languages and will provide insight into
the strengths and weaknesses of those languages by allowing direct
comparison of their use to implement the same algorithm.  One of the
languages must be DistAlgo, an extension of Python designed to make
distributed algorithms easier to write.  The other language can be any
programming language of your choice except Python (which overlaps too much
with DistAlgo).

[UPDATE 2014-09-29]
The DistAlgo distribution is available at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/distalgo/files/

============================================================
PHASE 0: TEAM FORMATION

find exactly one teammate.  one member of each team should send a message
to stoller@cs.stonybrook.edu containing the names and email addresses of
both team members.  if you cannot find a teammate, don't panic!  just send
me a message stating this, and I will find a teammate for you.  every team
will have exactly two members.  the only exception to this policy will be:
if the number of students in the class is odd, I will choose one person
with no teammate and either add them to a team or ask them to work alone.

------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 1: PSEUDO-CODE

1.  write complete pseudo-code for clients, servers, and the master that
supports all operations except transfer.  for clients, include only
pseudo-code for the protocol (e.g., keep track of which servers are
currently the head and tail), not pseudo-code for reading the configuration
file generating random requests, etc.  for servers, remember to maintain
the account information described above.  make threads, synchronization,
and communication explicit, keeping other aspects of the pseudo-code (e.g.,
data structures) at a high level of abstraction.  the pseudo-code should
include a reasonable amount of explanatory comments.  encapsulate the
details of the banking service operations in methods, so they do not
clutter the main part of the pseudo-code.

you may use the pseudo-code in [vRG2010replication] as a starting point if
desired.  keep in mind that it differs from what is required here in some
ways.  for example, it omits the algorithm for extending a chain, it omits
pseudo-code for failure detection, and it stores the entire history instead
of the current state, it sends the entire history instead of just the
necessary information in messages between servers and replies from servers
to clients, and it is not specialized to support the banking service.

the main purpose of pseudo-code is to demonstrate and convey understanding
of the algorithm.  clarity and readability are paramount.

2.  describe your design for extending the algorithm to handle transfers.
your design should satisfy the following requirement: if a transfer is
performed by (i.e., reflected in the account history at) any living server
of either bank involved in the transfer, then eventually all living servers
for both involved banks perform the transfer, regardless of whether the
client ever re-transmits the request.  informally, this prevents money from
disappearing (if only the source bank processed the transfer) or being
created (if only the destination bank processed the transfer).  note that
transfers performed by servers that crash do not necessarily get performed
by other servers; this is acceptable, because this algorithm does not use
persistent storage.  furthermore, the design should not use any explicit
timeouts.  note that this prohibits explicit periodic repetition of some
event until some other event occurs, because the periodic repetition is
driven by timeouts.  as in the core algorithm, any timing dependence should
be encapsulated in the assumption of perfect failure detection by the
master and the assumption of reliable communication between servers.
[UPDATE 2014-09-02: I rewrote this entire paragraph; re-read it carefully.]

give a convincing argument that your design is correct.  for examples of
such arguments, see the proof of correctness in [vRS2004chain] and in the
lecture notes on chain replication, and the "Why It Works" sections in
[vrG2010replication].

clarity and correctness are critical.  keep the design reasonably simple.
unnecessarily complicated designs will not receive full credit.  do not
complicate the design to achieve minor optimizations.  on the other hand,
the design should not contain inefficiencies that can be eliminated
without appreciably complicating the design.  if you are uncertain whether
you are striking the correct balance, you are welcome to ask the instructor
for guidance, preferably during office hours.

{UPDATE, 2014-09-18: Your design cannot change the functionality of the
master.  the master's only role is failure detection.]

3.  write complete pseudo-code for clients, servers, and the master that
supports all operations, including transfer.  of course, most of the
pseudo-code is copied from item 1.

[UPDATE: to save paper, the printout you submit does not need to include
item 1, since it is mostly a subset of item 3.]

------------------------------------------------------------ 
PHASE 2: NON-FAULT-TOLERANT SERVICE

in both languages, implement and test the clients and servers, except do
not implement algorithms to cope with failures, extend the chain, or
support transfers.  thus, clients issue requests, and servers handle them
appropriately (forwarding updates along the chain, etc.), provided no
failures occur.

------------------------------------------------------------ 
PHASE 3: FAULT-TOLERANT SERVICE

1.  in both languages, implement the master, extend the implementation with
algorithms to cope with failures and extend the chain, and test everything.

2.  write a comparison of your experience implementing the algorithm in the
two languages.  discuss and compare the size of the code in each language,
time and effort to write the initial version of the code, time and effort
to debug the initial version of the code, readability of the code,
similarity to the pseudo-code, and any other comments on the strengths and
weaknesses of the languages for various types of programming.  ideas for
language improvements are also welcome.

------------------------------------------------------------ 
PHASE 4: TRANSFERS

in one language of your choice, implement the extension to support
transfers.  if the design of the extension has changed after your phase 1
submission, update the description and pseudo-code from phase 1 to be
consistent with the implementation.

============================================================
SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

PHASE 0: send the email by 11:59pm on the due date.

PHASE 1: submit a printout in class on the due date, and submit the
document in the Assignments area on Blackboard by 11:59pm on the due date.

REMAINING PHASES: submit a zip (or tar) file in the Assignments area in
Blackboard by 11:59pm on the due date.  the file should be named
lastname1-lastname2-phaseN.zip (or lastname1-lastname2-phaseN.tar.gz),
where lastname1 and lastname2 are the last names of the team members, and N
is the phase number; for example, kenobi-skywalker-phase1.zip.  

[UPDATE, 2014-09-19: please leave the Comment box blank when you submit the
assignment on Blackboard.  we look only at the uploaded files.]

the zip (or tar) file should have the following structure and contents:

  README.txt   see details below
  testing.txt  description of testcases (see below)
  config/      configuration files
  src/client/  source code for client
  src/server/  source code for server
  src/master/  source code for master
  src/common/  source code used for multiple kinds of processes
  logs/        log files from running testcases described in README.txt
  phase1/      current version of material from phase1

README.txt should contain the following sections:

  INSTRUCTIONS.  instructions to compile and run your code.  the
  instructions should not assume that an IDE is installed.  for
  compilation, supply a Makefile or a detailed sequence of commands, not an
  IDE's project file.  include a specific example of the command to run a
  selected testcase.

  MAIN FILES (phases 2-4 only).  The full pathname (in your zip or tar
  file) of the files containing the main code for the client, server, and
  master.  (This will help graders look at the most important/interesting 
  code first, and look at other code used by it as needed.)
  [UPDATE, 2014-09-16: I added this item.]

  BUGS AND LIMITATIONS.  a list of all known bugs in and limitations of
  your code.

  LANGUAGE COMPARISON (phase 3 only).  comparison of your experience
  implementing the algorithm in the two languages.

  CONTRIBUTIONS.  a list of contributions of each team member to the
  current submission.  this should reflect how the work was divided between
  the team members.  generally, a dozen lines or so is sufficient detail.

  OTHER COMMENTS.  anything else you want us to know.

testing.txt should contain an entry for each testcase you developed.  each
entry should include: (1) description of the tested scenario (including
when failures occur), and (if appropriate) the specific aspect of the
program targeted by this scenario, (2) the name of the configuration file
used to run this testcase, (3) other information (if any) needed to run the
testcase, the expected outcome (passed or failed, with a brief explanation
of the problem if it failed).  testcases should be cumulative; in other
words, later submissions should include the testcases from previous
submissions.  you should have numerous testcases, so testing.txt should be
organized into sections in some reasonable way, so testcases for similar
scenarios are in the same section.

GRADING WEIGHTS (relative to the weight of the project in the course grade)

20% phase 1: pseudo-code
30% phase 2: non-fault-tolerant service
30% phase 3: fault-tolerant service
20% phase 4: transfers

============================================================
GRADING CRITERIA

several factors will be considered in grading, including:

functional correctness of code.

thorough testing.

code quality.  this encompasses all aspects of code quality other than
functional correctness, such as clarity, readability, maintainability,
extensibility, and efficiency.  one general measure of clarity is
similarity to high-level pseudo-code.  other factors include:

  Meaningful names for classes, methods, variables, etc.

  Consistent coding conventions

  Sufficient comments.

  Appropriate use of language features.  In DistAlgo, this includes use of
  DistAlgo-specific features and Python features, such as comprehensions.
  In general, it includes use of features such as inheritance, methods,
  generic types, comprehensions, enumeration types, for-each loops, and
  assertions.  For example, methods, inheritance, and loops should be used
  to avoid repeating blocks of identical or very similar code.  Low-level
  code should be encapsulated in methods.

  Modularity.  The code should be structured in a reasonable way into
  packages (if appropriate), classes and methods.  

there is sometimes a trade-off between clarity and efficiency.  the code
should not contain inefficiencies that can be eliminated without
appreciably complicating the code, but do not complicate the code to
achieve minor optimizations.  in many settings, including this class, code
clarity, readability, maintainability, etc., are more important.  if you
are uncertain whether you are striking the correct balance, you are welcome
to ask the instructor for guidance, preferably during office hours.

============================================================
DEMOS

demos will be held in the grad PC lab.  you may run the demo on one of the
lab PCs or your own laptop.

bring a printout of your README to the demo.  the TA will write notes on it
and keep it after the demo.

the demo timeslots are fairly short, so you should decide in advance which
testcases that you want to show the TA in order to convince him that your
program is correct.  please login and get organized in advance, so you are
ready to start running your program when your demo timeslot begins.
